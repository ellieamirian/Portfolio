      <p><b>Eating good food</b>, especially with family and friends, is one of the pleasures of life.We all know that people who eat healthy, balanced diets are likely to have:

plenty of energy to work and enjoy themselves;

fewer infections and other illnesses.

Children who eat well usually grow well.Women who eat well are likely to produce healthy babies. That is why it is important to know which combinations of foods make good meals and what the different food needs of different members of the family are.

    <p><b>A food is something that provides nutrients. Nutrients are substances that provide:</b>

<br>energy for activity, growth, and all functions of the body such as breathing, digesting food, and keeping warm;

<br>materials for the growth and repair of the body, and for keeping the immune system healthy.

    <br><p><b>There are many different nutrients.We divide them into:

    <br>Macro (big) nutrients that we need in large amounts. These are:</b>

    <br>carbohydrates (starches, sugars and dietary fibre);

    <br>fats - there are several kinds (see Box 4);

    <br>proteins - there are hundreds of different proteins.

    <br><b>Micro (small) nutrients that we need in small amounts. There are many of these but the ones most likely to be lacking in the diet are:</b><br>

    minerals - iron (see Box 6, page 19), iodine and zinc;

    <br>vitamins - vitamin A, B-group vitamins (including folate) and vitamin C.</p>
